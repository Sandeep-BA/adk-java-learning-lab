# Belgavi's Lab

**By Sandeep Belgavi.** Build and understand a small help-desk agent for Belgavi's Book Store, a fictional online bookstore, with ADK for Java, one capability per episode of [Belgavi's AI Lab](https://www.youtube.com/@belgaviai) on YouTube.

This repository grows with the series: each episode adds its lesson here when the video is released. Every lesson has a command, an expected result, a code walkthrough, a test and an exercise. The default examples require no model account or API key.

## 1. Check your tools

Install **JDK 17+**, **Maven 3.9+** and Git. Python **3.11+** is optional, for the Python comparison in each lesson.

```sh
java -version
mvn -version
git --version
```

Maven must report the intended JDK. If it reports an older Java version, fix `JAVA_HOME` before continuing.

## 2. Get the project

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Sandeep-BA/belgavis-lab.git
cd belgavis-lab
```

Run all commands below from this directory. No framework checkout or local SDK build is needed. Maven downloads the pinned `com.google.adk:google-adk:1.12.0` dependency.

## 3. Build and test

```sh
mvn -B -ntp -f java/pom.xml test
```

Expected: `BUILD SUCCESS`. The suite exercises real ADK runners and tools with a deterministic model fixture. It also checks invalid identifiers and missing records. The first build downloads dependencies and needs internet access; the offline model only removes the need for a model account.

## 4. Run your first agent

```sh
mvn -f java/pom.xml exec:java -Dexec.args="1 offline"
```

Expected: `OFFLINE FIXTURE: real ADK, simulated model`, followed by an `Offline hello` response. The model is simulated; ADK orchestration is real. This proves wiring, not live-model intelligence.

## 5. Follow the lessons

| Episode | What you build | Start here |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Your first agent, and how ADK runs it | [Your first agent](docs/01-first-agent.md) |
| 2 | A function tool that validates what the model sends | [Function tools](docs/02-function-tools.md) |

Episode 2's contrast demo runs the same inputs through an unchecked tool and the validated one:

```sh
mvn -f java/pom.xml exec:java -Dexec.args="contract"
```

**Coming next in the series:** sessions, state, guardrails, and workflows that chain lookup, policy and reply. Each lesson lands here with its episode. Watch or subscribe at [youtube.com/@belgaviai](https://www.youtube.com/@belgaviai).

### Python comparison

Each lesson also shows the Python equivalent with `google-adk` 2.12.0:

```sh
python -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e "./python[dev]"      # Windows: .venv\Scripts\pip
.venv/bin/python -m pytest python/tests -q
.venv/bin/python -m belgavi_adk.contract_demo
```

## 6. Understand the boundaries

- Only synthetic `CASE-1042` and `CASE-1043` records exist. The tools contact no external business system.
- Sessions are in memory and use a fixed demo identity. This is not a hosted authentication or persistence implementation.
- A live model is optional and may incur charges. See [live setup](docs/live-mode.md) before enabling it.
- [Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md) explains common setup and SDK warnings.
- [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) explains the code layout and execution flow.
- [References](docs/references.md) maps each lesson to the official docs, the pinned Google ADK source and relevant AICassindra articles.
